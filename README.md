# Improved-segmented-image-with-PCNN-and-GA-in-Matlab
First, the image is segmented with PCNN and weights are obtained for the desired segment with the genetic algorithm of the two objectives to optimize the PSNR and MSE of the obtained image. The two-objective genetic algorithm program was taken from the aa site and we put our own program inside it.
